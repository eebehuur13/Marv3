          <h3>What it is</h3>
          <p>
            Marble is an enterprise multimodal search and generation platform that turns scattered docs, sheets,
            decks, recordings, videos, and designs into a connected, living knowledge fabric.

          <h3>What it does</h3>
          <p>
            It indexes text, audio, video, and images into a shared semantic space so you can search by meaning across
            formats and turn results into grounded outputsâ€”summaries, reports, playbooks, and highlight reels.

          <h3>Why it fits the enterprise</h3>

            Permissions and roles enforced by default, full audit logs, compliance tagging, version history, and smooth
            collaboration via shareable searches, annotations, collections, and integrations with the tools you already
